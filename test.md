| Priority | Category of card                                        | Reason                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Blind-plays                                             | Demonstrating that a _Finesse_ or _Bluff_ occurred is very important. |
| 2        | Cards that lead into clued cards in someone else's hand | Otherwise, the team would lose _Tempo_.                               |
| 3        | Cards that lead into the player's own hand              | It is bad for a suit to be "held up" on one player.                   |
| 4        | 5's                                                     | Playing a 5 gets the team a free clue.                                |
| 5        | The lower rank card                                     | The smaller stacks are more important to fill up.                     |
| 6        | The left-most card                                      | The left-most card is more likely to be good.                         |
